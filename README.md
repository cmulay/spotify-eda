## Purpose

- The music industry is expanding faster than ever before. This market is fast expanding and getting more competitive. Companies must differentiate themselves by offering unique, artist-focused content or by inventing new pricing strategies. 
- Spotify, which was created in 2006, has grown to become the world's most popular streaming network. We shall study singers' song trends using the data provided from this site.
- From there, strategies to increase singers' popularity can be proposed, allowing them to be more competitive and successful in the music industry.
